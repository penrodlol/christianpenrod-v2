To anyone who may be reading this, welcome to my adventure into the dev blog
world! Now where to start ...

Over the past couple years, I've been super intrigued and inspired by the
seemingly infinite amount of dev blogs across the web. Although reading
documentation directly from a technology's source is essential, nothing quite
beats a solid blog post that's directly from those within the trenches solving
_real world_ problems and demonstrating how to do so along the way. With all
this in mind, I figured why not extend that favor and give this blog stuff a
shot.

I believe it's essential to establish a high level understanding of what
technical field(s) will be covered across these blog posts. For the context of
mine, I will be focusing primarily on _web development_. Although, I also
believe it's valid to sprinkle in other useful areas of technology every once
and awhile. Like most blog posts I find value in, I will add as many code
snippets as possible to denote what I'm trying to explain if not clear just by
reading. Having a visual example goes a long way.

Taking all this into mind, I again welcome you to my journey within the dev blog
realm and hope anyone reading these will find _real world_ value in them.
