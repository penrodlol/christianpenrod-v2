Lets by honest, talking about yourself in third-person is difficult, but here's
my best attempt at it...

I've been developing for the web since 2015. One of my primary interests
involves _developer experience_ (DX) tooling. I've worked in depth migrating
Angular codebases to Nx.

Another area of interest includes _responsive web design_. I enjoy creating
aesthetically pleasing, mobile friendly, accessible websites. I've worked
hands-on with frameworks such as Angular and Nextjs. And styling libraries
including Material Design, styled-components, and tailwindcss.

Although I'm not a qualified expert, I try to _teach_ others the knowledge I've
accumulated over the years. Whether that be through blog posts or just working
with my co-workers.
