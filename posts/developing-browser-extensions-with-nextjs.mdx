Although modern browsers offer a plethora of tooling to help assist web
development and general productivity, there will always be some niche
solution(s) not offered. How do we solve this? _Extensions!_

For the following example, we will showcase how easy it is to bundle a _Next.js_
application within a browser extension that's compatible with all Chromium-based
browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave) and Firefox.

It's worth mentioning that by using a rich framework like Next.js, we unlock the
ablity to create and scale a more complex web application. All embedded within a
browser extension.

## Setup

Lets begin by creating our Next.js application:

```bash
yarn create next-app demo-nextjs-browser-extension  --typescript

# All Chromium-based browsers.
yarn add -D @types/chrome

# Firefox.
yarn add -D @types/firefox-webext-browser
```

Now that we have our application, let add some dimensions to our body tag. This
will determine the size of the popup window when clicking on the extension's
icon within the browser's toolbar.

> The max dimensions allowed via Chromium browsers and Firefox is _800x600_
> pixels. [Chromium Source][chromium-dimensions] | [Firefox
> Source][firefox-dimensions]

```scss[title="globals.scss"]
body {
  width: 500px;
  min-height: 600px;
}
```

## Update Template

Once our dimensions are in place, lets update the template within our
application. For the following example, we will keep it simple but do note; we
could make a much more complex application with the help of a framework like
Next.js.

```tsx[title="index.tsx"]
import type { NextPage } from 'next';

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <section>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>This is a Next.js application. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

## Configuring The Manifest

Within all extensions, there exists a _manifest.json_ file. Think of this file
as the configuration file. It contains the extension's metadata and security
permissions as well as a pointer to our Next.js application. Let's now add this
file to our Next.js app's _/public_ directory:

[chromium-dimensions]:
  https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/views/extensions/extension_popup.h;l=60
[firefox-dimensions]:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Popups#popup_resizing
