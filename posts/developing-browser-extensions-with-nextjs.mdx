Although modern browsers offer a plethora of tooling to help assist web
development and general productivity, there will always be some niche
solution(s) not offered. How do we solve this? _Extensions!_

For the following example, we will showcase how easy it is to bundle a _Next.js_
application within a browser extension that's compatible with all Chromium-based
browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave) and Firefox.

It's worth mentioning that by using a rich framework like Next.js, we unlock the
ablity to create and scale a more complex web application. All embedded within a
browser extension.

## Setup

Lets begin by creating our Next.js application:

```bash
yarn create next-app demo-nextjs-browser-extension  --typescript
```
