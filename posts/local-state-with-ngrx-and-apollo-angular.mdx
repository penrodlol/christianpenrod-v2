Before building out new front-end features, planning a general approach to state
management is an essential piece of architecture I cannot stress enough. Within
this article, I want to provide a helpful solution in Angular for managing local
state when working with GraphQL. This involves 2 technologies: NgRx
ComponentStore & Apollo Angular.

<Aside>
  This article will cover topics that involve a basic understanding of
  [GraphQL][graphql], [Apollo Angular][apolloangular], and [NgRx][ngrx]. If you
  are unfamiliar with any of these technolgies, please read up on them before
  going futher.

## Setup

Let's begin by installing our dependencies:

<Code>

```bash
npm install @ngrx/component-store
ng add apollo-angular
```

</Code>

[graphql]: https://graphql.org/
[apolloangular]: https://apollo-angular.com/docs/
[ngrx]: https://ngrx.io/
